This session will provide hands-on experience on how you can migrate your databases to AWS with the objective to enable you to carry out your own migrations after the workshop. We will discuss the use of AWS Database Migration Services (DMS) and AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) for performing both homogenous (same source and target database types) and heterogeneous (different source and target database types) migrations. These tools can be used with both SQL-based and NoSQL-based data sources for migrating your on-premise data to destinations such as Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS) databases or Amazon DynamoDB tables. Participants will be provided step-by-step instructions to migrate data: 
    - from an Oracle Database source to an Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) target
    - from a MongoDB source to an Amazon DynamoDB target

Requirements: 
- Experience with Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax
- Experience with managing RDBMS and NoSQL databases

System Requirements: 
Participants are expected to bring their own laptop/device for completing the lab exercises with the following specifications:
    - Operating System: Fedora Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, or Ubuntu Linux version 15.04 (64-bit only)
    - Processor: multi-core CPU
    - Hard Disk: 5GB of free space
    - Memory: 1GB
    - Permission to install any software on the laptop/device (for example, Administrative rights for Microsoft Windows OS)

Software Requirements: 
Participants are also expected to download and pre-install the following tools on their laptop/device:
