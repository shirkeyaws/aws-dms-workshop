# README.md

This directory contains the source code for the runbooks -- the compiled runbook can be built using `make all`, and will produce an output to the ../bucket directory, representing the Amazon S3 bucket used for hosting the workshop artifacts.

Note: [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is required on the local system in order to build the runbook outputs.
