## Setup: SQL Database Management Tool (Optional)

In this step, we will install a database management tool of your choice locally.

> *For those participants not wishing to install a database management tool locally, you can use the DBeaver tool via Amazon AppStream 2.0 resources that will have been provisioned for you temporarily. See [Setup: Accessing Amazon AppStream 2.0 Tools](#setup-access-appstream-tools)*

Some popular and free tools include:

- SQL WorkbenchJ: <http://www.sql-workbench.net/downloads.html> 
- DBeaver: <http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/>
- SQuirrel: <http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/>

In this lab, we will be using SQL WorkbenchJ screenshots to demonstrate the lab activities.
