### AWS DMS Endpoints

#### AWS DMS Endpoints - List All

To create our new AWS DMS endpoints, we will first view the console for endpoints by visiting the following link:

> <http://amzn.to/aws-tokyo-dms-endpoints> (=> <https://ap-northeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dms/home?region=ap-northeast-1#endpoints:>)

You should now see the following screen:

Click the **Create Endpoint** button to proceed to creating the first endpoint.

#### AWS DMS Endpoints - Create Source

You should now see the following page:

#### DMS Endpoint - Enter Data for Source Endpoint

![AWS DMS Endpoints - Create Source Endpoint (Details)](images/step/aws_dms_endpoints/create-source-endpoint-1.png)

Enter the fields as follows:

- **Endpoint type**: (select default of Source)
- **Endpoint identifier**: dms-workshop-oracle
- **Source engine**: oracle
- **Server name**: (the Oracle Server Name/URL generated by the CloudFormation stack)
- **Port**: (the Oracle Server Port you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters, default is 1521)
- **SSL mode**: none
- **User name**: dbmaster
- **Password**: (the Oracle password you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters)
- **SID**: (the Oracle Database name you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters, default is ORCL)

For the test portion, fill the following details:

- **VPC**: (select the VPC marked with **workshop**)
- **Replication Instance**: (select the DMS Replication Instance created earlier)
- **Refresh schemas...**: (leave default of checked)

#### DMS Endpoint - Test Source Endpoint

Selecting the **workshop** VPC and the **DMS Replication Instance** that lives in that VPC that you created earlier, you can now test the connection from that Replication Instance instance to the Source database via the **DMS Endpoint** settings above. Click the **Run Test** button to proceed. A successful test will display as Connection Successfully Tested as shown below:

You can now click the **Save** button to save this endpoint.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and tested the Source endpoint. We will now repeat the process for the Target endpoint.

#### AWS DMS Endpoints - List All (Updated)

We will return to the DMS Endpoints view in the console by visiting the following link:

> <http://amzn.to/aws-tokyo-dms-endpoints> (=> <https://ap-northeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dms/home?region=ap-northeast-1#endpoints:>)

You should now see the following screen:

![AWS DMS Endpoints - List All (Updated)](images/step/aws_dms_endpoints/list-endpoints-updated.png)

Again, we will click to **Create Endpoint**, seeing the Create Endpoint page as before.

![AWS DMS Endpoints - Create Target Endpoint (Details)](images/step/aws_dms_endpoints/create-target-endpoint-1.png)

Enter the fields as follows:

- **Endpoint type**: Target
- **Endpoint identifier**: dms-workshop-postgres
- **Source engine**: postgres
- **Server name**: (the Postgres Server Name/URL generated by the CloudFormation stack)
- **Port**: (the Postgres Server Port you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters, default is 5432)
- **SSL mode**: none
- **User name**: (the Postgres password you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters, the default is postadmin)
- **Password**: (the Postgres password you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters)
- **Database name**: (the Postgres database name you provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters, default is postgres)

![AWS DMS Endpoints - Create Target Endpoint (Test)](images/step/aws_dms_endpoints/create-target-endpoint-2.png)

For the test portion, fill the following details:

- **VPC**: (select the VPC marked with **workshop**)
- **Replication Instance**: (select the DMS Replication Instance created earlier)
- **Refresh schemas...**: (leave default of checked)

#### DMS Endpoint - Test Target Endpoint

Selecting the **workshop** VPC and the **DMS Replication Instance** that lives in that VPC that you created earlier, you can now test the connection from that Replication Instance instance to the Target database via the **DMS Endpoint** settings above. Click the **Run Test** button to proceed. A successful test will display as Connection Successfully Tested as shown below:

![AWS DMS Endpoints - Create Target Endpoint (Test Success)](images/step/aws_dms_endpoints/create-target-endpoint-3.png)

You can now click the **Save** button to save this endpoint. You should now see the list of DMS Endpoints with two endpoints in an Active status as shown below:

![AWS DMS Endpoints - List Endpoints (Source and Target)](images/step/aws_dms_endpoints/create-target-endpoint-4.png)

You have now successfully created both DMS Endpoints, Source and Target, and you can now move to the creation of a DMS Task.
