## Setup JDBC Drivers

If you have chosen to locally install the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and your preferred database management tool, you will also need to download the database-specific JDBC drivers to connect to the database resources in this workshop. These JDBC drivers can be found at the following links:

- <http://bit.ly/postgres-jdbc>
- <http://bit.ly/oracle-jdbc>

> *The Oracle JDBC requires that you accept the associated license agreement before downloading -- the actual file required from the linked page is called **ojdbc7.jar***

You will need to download both drivers to your local hard drive for later use by both the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and your preferred database management tool.
