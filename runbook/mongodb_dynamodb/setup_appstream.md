When copying into your AppStream session, you will need to using the menu bar at the top of the AppStream screen, as show below:

![Amazon AppStream 2.0 Copy-Paste Menu](images/setup/access_appstream/copy-paste-menu.png)

By selecting the **Paste to remote session** option, you will now be presented with a dialog (shown below is the Mac OS X version):

![Amazon AppStream 2.0 Copy-Paste Menu](images/setup/access_appstream/paste.png)

Following the instructions (using either {Command-V} in Mac, or {Control-V} on Windows), the dialog will automatically disappear and the buffer for pasting will now be transferred to the remote desktop, where it can be pasted using the standard Windows paste keys of {Control-V}.
